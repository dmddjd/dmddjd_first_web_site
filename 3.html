    <p>Following the report of the Strath Committee in 1955, the British government developed contingency plans for the continuity of government.
        <br>This included construction of the underground Central Government War Headquarters (CGWHQ), codenamed "Burlington",
        <br>at Corsham in Wiltshire. As planned, it would have been a "reserve Whitehall" where the central government
        <br>could be moved in an emergency and, hopefully, survive a nuclear attack.</p>
